Why: [WIP]... ðŸš§ A

### How to Get Started

#### web-app

- Run `yarn` inside the package
- Ask for a maintainer to give you the necessary ENV keys
  - Check then the file `src/checkEnv.ts`and **any new variables** must be placed inside that const besides the normal .env change
- Before adding any new major library please check the Vite documentation first
  - You will also need a core developer to approve this or it will be reverted

### Tech Stack

**Shared** Typescript, Clerk (Auth)

**Front-end:** Vite, Typescript, React, ReactQuery, TanstackRouter, TailwindCSS

**Back-end:** Node, Typescript, Fastify, Postgresql?

OBS: If you are new to ReactQuery, TanstackRouter or Fastify, i highly recommend taking a read into the oficial documentation for each one.
